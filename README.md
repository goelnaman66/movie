# Movie Recommendation App

This is a movie recommendation app build using React for the front-end, express for the back-end, flask for handelling the recommendations and mongoDB for the database.

SurprisingLib is used in this project to generate recommendations using a Cosine similarity-based nearest neighbours method. Dummy users are built using the moviewlens 100K dataset for testing purposes. There are at least 20 movie ratings for each user.
